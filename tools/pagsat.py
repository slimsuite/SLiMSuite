Module:       PAGSAT
Description:  Pairwise Assembled Genome Sequence Analysis Tool
Version:      2.4.0
Last Edit:    12/04/18
Copyright (C) 2015  Richard J. Edwards - See source code for GNU License Notice

Function:
    This module is for the assessment of an assembled genome versus a suitable reference. For optimal results, the
    reference genome will be close to identical to that which should be assembled. However, comparative analyses should
    still be useful when different assemblies are run against a related genome - although there will not be the same
    expectation for 100% coverage and accuracy, inaccuracies would still be expected to make an assembly less similar
    to the reference.

Input:
    Main input for PAGSAT is an assembled genome in fasta format (`assembly=FILE`) and a reference genome in fasta format
    (`refgenome=FILE` or `reference=FILE`) with corresponding `*.gb` or `*.gbk` genbank download for feature extraction.
    For full function, a features table plus protein and gene sequences should be provided. (These will be parsed from
    a Genbank reference file.) Basic contig-reference mapping and plotting will still be performed with a pure sequence
    reference that lacks features or gene sequences.

    ### ~ Reference Sequence Naming ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ###
    PAGSAT expects a particular naming format for assembly sequences, which is a bit more constrained that most programs.
    This is to enable the full suite of visualisation with clear unambiguous labelling of contigs. Input sequence names
    must be in the form: `ctgXX_SPCODE__ACCBASE.YY`, where both `ctgXX` and `YY` are *unique* for each contig.
    (Generally `XX` and `YY` will match but this is not a requirement.) `ACCBASE` could be the same for all sequences, or
    it could be sequence-specific. It can also include `.` characters: only the final `.` element must be unique. `YY`
    must end with numbers. (These are expected to be contig numbers, possibly with a prefix.)

Output:
    Main output is a number of delimited text files and PNG graphics made with R. Details to follow.

    NOTE: Snapper is now used for the underlying Reference vs Assembly GABLAM searches (unless `snapper=F`). For speed,
    the SNP mapping functions are switched off. To get the full set of Snapper outputs, use `makesnp=T`.

    ### ~ MapFas Output ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ###
    The `mapfas=T` function generates a new copy of the assembly (in the main PAGSAT output directory) in which contigs
    have been reorientated to be the same strand as the reference chromosomes where possible. This is performed on the
    basis of the reference chromosome with maximum unique coverage for each contig, e.g the contig will be matched to the
    reference chromosome for which it has the most bases that ONLY map to that chromosome. (Clearly this will only work
    if the reference is haploid!) Where the majority of matching bases are on the negative strand, the contig will be
    reverse complemented and the accnum updated such that `XXXX.YY` becomes `XXXX.RYY`.

    If the assembly has `*.coverage.tdt` and `*.depthplot.tdt` data (generated by
    `SeqSuite.SAMTools` or `PAGSAT` if a `*.sam` file is provided), these files will be converted to `*.map.*.tdt` that
    match the `*.map.fasta` contigs.
